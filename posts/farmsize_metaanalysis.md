Check out our new article (as a pdf [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350400524_Higher_yields_and_more_biodiversity_on_smaller_farms), on Nature's website [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-021-00699-2), or at readcube [here](https://www.rdcu.be/chtQv)), where we synthesize the last 50 years of research. 

We found that smaller farms harbour more biodiversity and have higher yields.
